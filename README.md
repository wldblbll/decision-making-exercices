# Thinking and Decision-Making Exercises

This repository contains a series of Streamlit applications designed to explore cognitive biases, decision-making processes, and probabilistic thinking. Each application presents a different exercise to help users understand and improve their thinking and decision-making skills.

## Applications Overview

### 1. Thinking about Thinking

**Description**: This application challenges users to identify the rule governing a sequence of numbers. Users can test their hypotheses by generating sequences and checking if they conform to the rule.

**Features**:
- **Sequence Testing**: Users can input sequences of numbers to test against the hidden rule.
- **Feedback**: Immediate feedback on whether the sequence conforms to the rule.
- **Eureka Moment**: Users can submit their hypothesized rule and receive feedback.

**Usage**:
1. Guess the rule for the sequence `2, 4, 6`.
2. Enter a sequence of three numbers separated by commas to test your hypothesis.
3. Once you think you have found the rule, describe it and click the "Eureka!" button.

### 2. Algorithms for Better Decisions

**Description**: This application measures the consistency of user judgments by asking them to estimate the percentage of a planet's surface covered by ocean across multiple images.

**Features**:
- **Image Assessment**: Users view images of a planet and estimate the ocean coverage.
- **Consistency Measurement**: The application measures the variance in user responses to identical images presented in different orientations.
- **Feedback**: Users receive feedback on the consistency of their judgments.

**Usage**:
1. View each image and use the slider to estimate the percentage of the surface covered by the ocean.
2. Click "Next" to proceed to the next image.
3. After completing all images, view the results to see the consistency of your judgments.

### 3. Dealing with Uncertainty

**Description**: This application presents a scenario where users must make a decision under uncertainty regarding the launch of a new product.

**Features**:
- **Scenario-Based Decision Making**: Users are given a scenario and must choose the best decision based on uncertain market demand.
- **Feedback**: Users receive feedback on their decision-making process.

**Usage**:
1. Read the scenario about launching a new product.
2. Select the answer that best represents the average margin you expect to achieve.
3. Submit your answer and receive feedback.

### 4. How to Update Your Beliefs?

**Description**: This application explores Bayesian reasoning by asking users to update their beliefs based on new information.

**Features**:
- **Probability Estimation**: Users estimate the probability of an event and update their beliefs based on new information.
- **Feedback**: Users receive feedback on their probabilistic reasoning.

**Usage**:
1. Estimate the initial probability of a woman having breast cancer.
2. Update your probability estimate after receiving a positive mammogram result.
3. Submit your answers and receive feedback.
